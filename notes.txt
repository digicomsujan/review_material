This code is from a larger project, but I have extracted the problematic part here. Their is not much problem with the code, since it is working fine. But the issue is it takes too long to process the whole code. The original function is "index_bkup" and I tried to optimize it to "index" function but It still is slow. Upto 10 min is fine for me, but it takes half an hour to completely run the code. The following are the steps that the function performs. Some warning may come but can ignore it. The main issue is time.


->loop through date
->loop through employee
->check shift
->check holiday
->check leave
->check weekend
->check half present
->check half leave
->check shift roster
->roundtime attendance calculation ( optional )
->generate attendance
