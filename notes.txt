-> if possible uncomment line  "->where("{$current_date} BETWEEN date(leave_from) and date(leave_to)")" and show alternative way to do this
-> same for employee_model // " and '{$date}' between leave_from and leave_to"; line no 43

->loop through date
->loop through employee
->check shift
->check holiday
->check leave
->check weekend
->check half present
->check half leave
->check shift roster
->roundtime attendance calculation ( optional )
->generate attendance 

currently, the "index_bkup" function is working fine but takes too much time. it may take from 1 min to 2 - 3 hours depending upon the data

The index function is my way to make it run faster but it didn't work well.

I need something that can run in less than 10 minutes however much the data be. I have prepared a database of around 200 users and around 100 days of attendance.


The code may show some warning but attendance will be generated and stored in attendance table
